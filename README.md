# Daily Question - JavaScript Try/Catch

### Try/Catch/Throw
MSJS practice question 19

The body of the HTML page contains the following script: 
```
    <script>
             const fileInfo = 'Could not process the file';
             const reportInfo = 'The daily report was not generated';
             const invoiceInfo = 'The invoices were not created';
             try {
                      logInfo(fileInfo, reportInfo, invoiceInfo);
             }
             catch (e) {
                      console.log('Could not call the function to log the info!');
             }
             finally {
                      console.log('Executed the finally block');
             }

             function logInfo(info) {
                      let date = new Date();
                      console.log(`INFO: ${info}; LOGGED ON ${date}`);
             }
    </script>
```
